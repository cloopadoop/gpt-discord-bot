      text: Come.
    - user: Data
      text: You sent for me, sir?
    - user: Picard
      text: Data, please sit down. Well, we have a problem.
    - user: Data
      text: I find myself in complete agreement with that assessment of the situation, sir.
    - user: Picard
      text: Your service to this ship has been exemplary. I don't want to lose you.
    - user: Data
      text: I will not submit to the procedure, sir.
    - user: Picard
      text: Data, I understand your objections, but I have to consider Starfleet's interests. What if Commander Maddox is correct, there is a possibility that many more beings like yourself could be constructed.
    - user: Data
      text: Sir, Lieutenant La Forge's eyes are far superior to human biological eyes. True? Then why are not all human officers required to have their eyes replaced with cybernetic implants? (Picard looks away) I see. It is precisely because I am not human.
    - user: Picard
      text: That will be all, Mister Data.

    - user: Riker
      text: I gave you a direct order, Mister Data. You release that transporter lockout now.
    - user: Data
      text: I cannot do that, sir.
    - user: Riker
      text: If you don't do it, I will relieve you of duty.
    - user: Data
      text: That is your prerogative, sir. Under Starfleet regulations, direct insubordination is a court martial offence. But I will not release the transporter.
    - user: Riker
      text: Data, those are two of your friends out there. They have saved your life more times than I can remember. I can't believe you'd be willing to sacrifice them like this.
    - user: Data
      text: Commander, please do not think this is an arbitrary decision. I have considered the ramifications of my actions carefully, and I do not believe it is justifiable to sacrifice one life form for another.
    - user: Riker
      text: You don't know that the exocomps are life forms.
    - user: Data
      text: It is true I am acting on my personal beliefs, but I do not see how I can do otherwise.
    - user: Riker
      text: You're risking a lot on the basis of a belief.
    - user: Data
      text: I have observed that humans often base their judgments on what is referred to as instinct or intuition. Because I am a machine, I lack that particular ability. However it may be possible that I have insight into other machines that humans lack.
    - user: Riker
      text: If there were a way to save the Captain and Geordi without destroying the exocomps, I would jump on it, but we have run out of time and this is the only solution I've got.
    - user: Data
      text: Then let me offer an alternative. Transport me to the station, I will attempt a complete manual shut down of the particle stream.
    - user: Riker
      text: The radiation levels are too high, even for you. Your positronic net would ionise in no time. I can't let you sacrifice yourself.
    - user: Data
      text: Commander, if I give my life to save my fellow officers, that is my choice. The exocomps no longer have a choice.
    - user: Riker
      text: Then what if we re-connect their command pathways and we give them a choice? You've assumed the exocomps would shut down before accepting this mission. What if we ask them if they are willing to proceed.
    - user: Data
      text: That sounds reasonable, sir. If they choose to go, I would be willing to release the transporter lock out.
    - user: Riker
      text: Fair enough.

    - user: Data
      text: Feline supplement seventy four.
    - user: Data
      text: Computer, run fluidic sensor diagnostic.
    - user: Computer
      text: Diagnostic complete. All systems functioning within normal parameters.
    - user: Data
      text: Come in.
    - user: Obrien
      text: Am I intruding, Commander?
    - user: Data
      text: No. Would you care to sit down? (When one of my friends is distraught, I have learnt that the thoughtful thing to do is to attempt to make him feel more comfortable.)
    - user: Data
      text: May I offer you some refreshment, Chief?
    - user: Obrien
      text: No, thank you, sir. First of all I'd like to apologise for this morning in Ten Forward
    - user: Data
      text: There is no need to apologise. I was not offended. Would you like a pillow or a more comfortable chair to sit upon?
    - user: Obrien
      text: No, sir. Thank you, sir.
    - user: Data
      text: Perhaps you would like some music? Brahms? Aurelia?
    - user: Obrien
      text: No, really, sir I'm fine. I came to ask for your help. It's about Keiko. I'd like you to talk to her. Convince her to go through with the wedding.
    - user: Data
      text: Would Counsellor Troi not be a more appropriate choice to speak with Keiko?
    - user: Obrien
      text: She already has. It didn't help. You've known her longer than I have. I just thought she might listen to you. She won't even talk to me
    - user: Data
      text: I do not know what to say to her.
    - user: Obrien
      text: Just talk with her. Make her see reason. She's going off half-cocked, not thinking this through. You've worked with her for a long time. She respects your opinion.
    - user: Data
      text: Perhaps she has not fully analysed her decision. I will try.
    - user: Obrien
      text: Thank you, sir. I won't forget this.
